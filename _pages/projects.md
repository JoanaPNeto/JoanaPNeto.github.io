## Transparent ECoG 

*Transparent and flexible electrode arrays for large-scale neural recordings with high spatial and temporal resolution*
2020

The goal of this project is to fabricate large-scale, high-density transparent and flexible electrode arrays, that combine the superior temporal resolution of extracellular electrophysiology with the spatial resolution offered by optical imaging. This project will explore the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of emerging transparent conductive materials for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays. The validation of new transparent ECoG will be performed in vivo by combining extracellular recordings with functional calcium imaging.

Parylene membranes ( 1 to 5 µm thick) are biocompatible and compatible with standard microfabrication processes (e.g., photolitography). In collaboration with Professor Joana Vaz Pinto and master students, we were able to fabricate on thin Parylene membranes- TFTs, MIM, Resistors, Capacitors, temperature and UV sensors, as well as RFID antennas.    


## Microfluidics
*Integrated Microfluidic Device for cancer detection from free circulating DNA using Digital PCR*
2020

The project involves fabricating a microfluidic device for the rapid detection of cancer from circulating free DNA in blood and urine. For effectively addressing the challenges present in this project we must combine different materials and microfabrication technologies, such as direct laser writing (DLW). This novel technology enables a fast fabrication of precise and complex microstructures which are much more difficult and time demanding to fabricate with patterning technologies, like photolithography. Recently, Joana won a Yerun Mobility award to visit Vellekoop Group at Bermen University to explore this technology.      

## Interfacing Materials and Neuroscience 
*Materials and neuroscience: validating tools for large-scale, high density neural recording*
2016

This project was developed in the context of my PhD. Extracellular recording remains the only technique capable of measuring the activity of many neurons simultaneously with a sub-millisecond precision, in multiple brain areas, including deep structures. Nevertheless, many questions about the nature of the detected signal and the limitations/capabilities of this technique remain unanswered.

*“What contributes to the amplitude of action potentials as well as the background noise? Can we improve data quality by electrodes design choice (e.g., impedance and size)? How will these be reflected in the subsequent sorting analysis? What arrangement of electrodes is optimal for isolating individual neurons from background noise? How can we validate probes with different electrode configurations and different sorting algorithms? How can we achieve the full potential of large-scale, high-density extracellular recordings?”*

For understanding and improving neural probes, we provided new methods to quantify their performance, as well as new validation datasets. All data was made freely available online. These datasets have been used by several groups to publish in top-ranked journals, contributing to the advancement of knowledge. Moreover, extracellular neural probes have made a big step towards the large-scale, high-density extracellular recordings. In collaboration with the European Project NeuroSeeker, we validated a CMOS-based probe with 1344 electrodes allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning different brain regions. We also presented new methods for visualizing and analysing big neural data. Additionally, given the ever-shrinking dimensions of CMOS technology it is now possible to fabricate sub-cellular electrodes (< 10 µm). How small and closely-packed can one make extracellular microelectrodes?
