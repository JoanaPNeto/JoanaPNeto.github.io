## Transparent ECoG 

*Transparent and flexible electrode arrays for large-scale neural recordings with high spatial and temporal resolution*
2018

In 2018 I have started to explore, as a PosDoctoral Research Scientist in CENIMAT/I3N and Sainsbury Welcome Centre, new transparent materials for extracellular electrodes. The goal of this project is to fabricate large-scale, high-density transparent and flexible electrode arrays, that combine the superior temporal resolution of extracellular electrophysiology with the spatial resolution offered by optical imaging. This project will explore the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of emerging transparent conductive materials for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays. The validation of new transparent ECoG will be performed in vivo by combining extracellular recordings with functional calcium imaging. Currently, I’m supervising a master student, in collaboration with Hugo Marques from Champalimaud Neuroscience Program, working on *Transparent and flexible ECoG electrode arrays of metallic nanostructures for neural recordings*. 


## Ultra-thin and conformable Parylene-based circuitry 

2018

Parylene membranes (1 to 5 µm thick) are biocompatible and compatible with standard microfabrication processes (e.g., photolitography). In collaboration with Professor Joana Vaz Pinto working at CENIMAT/I3N, we were able to fabricate on ultra-thin Parylene membranes- TFTs, MIM, Resistors, Capacitors, temperature and UV sensors, as well as RFID antennas. We co-supervise several master students working in this subject - (1)*Development of temperature sensor arrays in ultrathin membranes of Parylene*, (2)*Development of of Temperature sensors in Parylene membranes*, (3)*Integration of IC temperature sensors in conformable membranes of Parylene*, (4)*Fabrication of RFID antennas in Parylene membranes for wearables*, and (5)*Fabrication of UV sensors in Parylene membranes for wearables.* 


## Microfluidics

*Integrated Microfluidic Device for cancer detection from free circulating DNA using Digital PCR*
2019

In 2019, I've started as Posdoctoral Research Associate at CENIMAT/I3N. The project involves fabricating a microfluidic device for the rapid detection of cancer from circulating free DNA in blood and urine. For effectively addressing the challenges present in this project we must combine different materials and microfabrication technologies, such as direct laser writing (DLW). This novel technology enables a fast fabrication of precise and complex microstructures, which are much more difficult and time demanding to fabricate with standard patterning technologies, like photolithography. Recently, Joana won a Yerun Research Mobility Award to visit Vellekoop Group at Bermen University to explore this technology.      

## Interfacing Materials and Neuroscience 

*Materials and neuroscience: validating tools for large-scale, high density neural recording*
2012

This was my PhD project. Extracellular recording remains the only technique capable of measuring the activity of many neurons simultaneously with a sub-millisecond precision, in multiple brain areas, including deep structures. Nevertheless, many questions about the nature of the detected signal and the limitations/capabilities of this technique remain unanswered.

*“Can we improve data quality by electrodes design choice (e.g., impedance and size)? How will these be reflected in the subsequent sorting analysis? What arrangement of electrodes is optimal for isolating individual neurons from background noise? How can we validate probes with different electrode configurations and different sorting algorithms? How can we achieve the full potential of large-scale, high-density extracellular recordings?”*

For understanding and improving neural probes, we provided new methods to quantify their performance, as well as new validation datasets. All data was made freely available online. These datasets have been used by several groups to publish in top-ranked journals, contributing to the advancement of knowledge. Moreover, extracellular neural probes have made a big step towards the large-scale, high-density extracellular recordings. In collaboration with the European Project NeuroSeeker, we validated a CMOS-based probe with 1344 electrodes allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning different brain regions. In collaboration with Gonçalo Lopes and George Dimitriadis, we presented new methods for visualizing and analysing big neural data. Additionally, given the ever-shrinking dimensions of CMOS technology it is now possible to fabricate sub-cellular electrodes (< 10 µm). Neuroscientists must decide whether this increase in recording density is actually useful for future probe designs, and if different brain regions require different designs. 


## Ph Sensor 

2014

During my PhD, I explored the electrodeposition thecnique at Cenimat/I3N, showing that was possible to reliable coat metal electrodes with different materials (e.g. WO3 and PEDOT-PSS). In collaboration with Lídia Santos, we fabricated WO3 nanoparticle-based conformable pH sensors. These sensors shown a sensitivity of −56.7 ± 1.3 mV/pH, in a wide pH range of 9 to 5. A good balance between sensitivity, production costs, and simplicity of the sensors was accomplished.
