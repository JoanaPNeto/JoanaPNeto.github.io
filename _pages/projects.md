## Transparent ECoG 

*Transparent and flexible electrode arrays for large-scale neural recordings with high spatial and temporal resolution*

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/TransparentECoG/projecto1.jpg)

The goal of this project is to fabricate large-scale, high-density transparent and flexible electrode arrays based on emerging transparent conductive materials, that combine the superior temporal resolution of extracellular electrophysiology with the
spatial resolution offered by optical imaging. This project will explore the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of emerging transparent conductive materials for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays. The validation of new transparent ECoG will be performed in vivo by combining extracellular recordings with functional calcium imaging.
