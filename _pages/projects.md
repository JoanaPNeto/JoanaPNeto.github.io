## Transparent ECoG 

*Transparent and flexible electrode arrays for large-scale neural recordings with high spatial and temporal resolution*

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/TransparentECoG/projecto1.jpg)

The goal of this project is to fabricate large-scale, high-density transparent and flexible electrode arrays, that combine the superior temporal resolution of extracellular electrophysiology with the spatial resolution offered by optical imaging. This project will explore the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of emerging transparent conductive materials for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays. The validation of new transparent ECoG will be performed in vivo by combining extracellular recordings with functional calcium imaging.


## Ultra-thin and conformable Parilene-based circuitry

Parylene membranes ( 1 to 5 Âµm thick) are biocompatible and compatible with standard microfabrication processes (e.g., photolitography). In collaboration with Professor Joana Vaz Pinto and some master students, we were able to fabricate TFTs, MIM, Resistors, Capacitors, temperature and UV sensors, as well as RFID antennas.    


## Microfluidics
*Integrated Microfluidic Device for cancer detection from free circulating DNA using Digital PCR*

The project involves fabricating a microfluidic device for the rapid detection of cancer from circulating free DNA in blood and urine. For effectively addressing the challenges present in this project we must combine different materials and microfabrication technologies, such as direct laser writing (DLW). This novel technology enables a fast fabrication of precise and complex microstructures which are much more difficult and time demanding to fabricate with patterning technologies, like photolithography. Recently, Joana won a Yerun Mobility award to visit Vellekoop Group at Bermen University to explore this technology.
