<p>Joana Neto, a biomedical engineer, with experience in a range of diverse projects has been assembling knowledge and insight from different disciplines - Materials Science, Neuroscience, Micro and Nanotechnology, and (bio)Sensors.</p>


<p>Over her scientific carer she has worked at CENIMAT/I3N, Champalimaud Center for the Unknown and Sainsbury Wellcome Centre. She is author of 10 publications, H-index=7 with 310 citations. She has experience teaching and supervising students, leading projects and collaborating with scientists from different fields.</p>


<p>Her research has focused on on extracellular recording, the oldest technique used to measure brain activity. Many questions about the nature of the detected signal and the limitations/capabilities of this technique remain unanswered. The aim of her work is to answer some of these questions in order to understand and achieve the full potential of neural probes used for large-scale, high-density extracellular recordings.</p> 


<p>Having the power of building and validating tools that can help neuroscientists to understand ‘how the brain works’ have attracted Joana for pursuing a research career in the field of interfacing technology with the brain. More than ever, tech giants (Facebook and Neuralink by Ellon Musk) are starting to recognize the impact that brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can have in the near future, and extracellular recordings constitutes the technology behind most BMIs. Joana hopes to take full advantage of this technique and work towards its future applications.</p>
